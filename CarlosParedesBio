# Juan Carlos Paredes

Juan Carlos Paredes is an independent researcher developing substrate structure theory, a mathematical framework that unifies number theory with cosmological phenomena. His work reframes fundamental physics questions—including dark matter and galaxy rotation—through geometric spacetime properties rather than undiscovered particles.

Paredes holds a BA in Humanities and Fine Arts from Wabash College and an MBA from Monterey Institute of International Studies. He has filed provisional patents on Information-Theoretic Orchestration in Federated Graphs (IT-OFNG) and the Cosmic Substrate Operating System (CSOS), frameworks for substrate-mediated coordination across distributed computing, autonomous robotics, and planetary-scale systems. Additional applications in development include Matter Forge (geometric substrate orchestration for material synthesis) and Transformation Resistance Information Systems (TRIS), which treats computation as resistance patterns rather than state transformations.

His theoretical work connects the ABC conjecture with conformal cyclic cosmology and explores relationships between Mochizuki's Inter-universal Teichmuller theory and the amplituhedron. He has demonstrated how material substrates enable faster temporal integration through quantum geometric phase relationships.

Paredes operates under different pseudonymsfor select projects, emphasizing context separation as both practical philosophy and technical requirement.
